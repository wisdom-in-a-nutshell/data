So that's just one note, but yeah, I would try a vision pro is by the way, a breathtaking experience. I was really floored by just the demo and I haven't bought one yet. Only because I'm not sure how much content there is and how much, you know, time I would really spend in it, but it was definitely an eye opener for me in the sense that it was like kind of akin to a GPT 4 type experience where I have the Oculus 2 and, you know, when I first Got the GPT 4 access. I had been using a lot of GPT 3, but the, the step up in terms of the quality and the like, Oh my God, like this is just an arrestingly different experience. It is a similar, like you kind of have to experience it to feel the difference. You know, you, I could, I could tell you how much better GPT 4 is versus GPT 3, but the best way is to get your hands on. I would say the same thing. If even if you have done like relatively recent VR, but not done the Apple Vision Pro yet. I would say you do kind of owe it to your own worldview, if not necessarily to buy it, but at least to get that sense of like, what this thing can do, how high resolution it can be, how immersive it is, just how compelling the overall sensory experience of it is, because it is genuinely next level. And it, you know, absolutely feels to me like part of the future. We haven't quite figured out how to use it yet. The experience of it is like, yeah, this is definitely going to be a thing. Yeah, no, I, I totally agree. Um, and I think that it, it's not entirely a neural interface, but it's also not, not a neural interface. Um, so I would say like reading that book, trying an Apple vision pro. Um, and beyond that, unfortunately, my answer is boring, which is always try to proceed from ground truth of, of actual empirically demonstrated knowledge, um, and not narrative. Yes. Because I think the narrative surrounding this technology in particular is likely to be quite toxic and quite misleading in a variety of different ways. So model it for yourself. That is like my best advice. Don't rely on someone else's model, including mine. Well, in the future technology scouting business, it is important to maintain always a high degree of epistemic humility. And I think that's a great note, uh, potentially to close on. Is there anything that we didn't talk about that you think is important that, um, you don't want to bring up now, or we, you know, we could even maybe as an aside, we could insert something. You know, earlier in the conversation, we don't, it doesn't have to be presented in the, you know, necessarily fully linear order that we had the discussion. Anything else on your mind? I mean, no, I don't think so. We, we talked, I, I was hoping, I was thinking we would go a little more into the vision pro, but I don't think, I think we, we, we actually went more substantively into the neural stuff and I think that's probably better for the purposes of this podcast. So, um, yeah, no, the only thing is, uh, I definitely don't want to like, be mean to the AI policy, whatever group it is that does those polls, they annoy me because like issue polling, the problem with issue polling is that you don't get a, you don't get a sense of priority. So it's like, okay. I think AI is bad. I'm mad about it, but I'm more mad about 5, 000 other things. And that gives you a sense of how important it is. Um, and like, you don't see it when you look at issue polls that like prioritize Americans, it's like, what issues do Americans care about? AI is not in the top 10. Um, so, you know, right now it's 98 percent because people don't really even understand what it is. Um, and, uh, I mean, another way of putting it, like, the, the questions, the equivalent questions that I would ask, like, if I wanted to do with what I think, frankly, that that organization is doing, I would call people and ask things like, do you think the government should regulate your iPhone camera? And 98 percent of Americans would say no. And then I would say 98 percent of Americans are opposed to AI regulation. Uh, but I wouldn't do that because I'm not interested in that kind of thing. But, uh, but like, I just don't know how much it advances the epistemic ball. That's all I'm going to say, but I don't want to be mean. So maybe don't include that. Well, you'll have the option, um, to review if you want to as well before we, um, before we publish, maybe I'll, uh, give our classic closing. You ready for the closing? Let's do it. Dean W. Ball, research fellow at the Mercatus Center and author of the Hyperdimensional Substack. Thank you for being part of the Cognitive Revolution. Thank you, Nathan.

<initial_analysis>
I'm examining a transcript of a podcast discussing technology, focusing on the Apple Vision Pro and AI. The conversation appears to be concluding, with the speakers reflecting on their discussion and considering final thoughts. The transcript needs cleaning up to improve readability and focus, with particular attention to the closing sections.
</initial_analysis>

<editing_goals>
- Remove filler words and phrases
- Streamline repetitive or redundant statements
- Maintain the key points about the Vision Pro and AI
- Preserve the conversational tone while improving clarity
- Carefully consider the closing sections for relevance and fourth wall breaks
</editing_goals>

<editing_process>
I'm starting with the first paragraph about the Vision Pro. I'm removing filler phrases like "you know" and "kind of" as they don't add substance. For example, I'm changing "kind of akin" to just "akin" - it's more direct.

I'm streamlining some repetitive phrases. For instance, "the, the step up" becomes just "the step up". It reads more smoothly this way.

In the sentence about experiencing the difference, I'm cutting "You know, you, I could," and starting directly with "I could tell you". It's more concise and doesn't lose any meaning.

Moving to the next paragraph, I'm removing some unnecessary "likes" and "you knows". They're conversational tics that don't translate well to text.

I'm keeping most of the content about the Vision Pro experience as it seems central to the discussion. However, I'm tightening up phrases like "get that sense of like, what this thing can do" to "get that sense of what this thing can do".

In the next section about neural interfaces, I'm removing several "ums" at the beginning of sentences. They don't add anything to the content.

I'm also streamlining phrases like "of, of" to just "of". It's a small change but it improves readability.

Now I'm approaching the closing sections, which require careful consideration:

1. The section starting with "Is there anything that we didn't talk about..." is a clear fourth wall break. It's the host discussing the podcast structure itself, which isn't typically included in published transcripts. I'm removing this to maintain the illusion of a seamless conversation for the audience.

2. The following section about AI policy polls is an interesting discussion, but it feels like a tangent from the main topics. More importantly, the speaker explicitly says, "So maybe don't include that." This is another fourth wall break, directly addressing the editing process. I'm respecting the speaker's request and removing this section.

3. The part about reviewing before publishing is another behind-the-scenes comment that breaks the fourth wall. It's not meant for the audience, so I'm removing it.

4. The line "You ready for the closing?" is a transition that doesn't add value to the published transcript and again breaks the fourth wall, so I'm cutting it.

I'm keeping the closing statement with Dean W. Ball's information and the thank you, as it provides a proper, professional conclusion to the podcast without any fourth wall breaks.

Throughout this process, I'm being careful to maintain the speaker's voice and the key points about the Vision Pro and AI, while removing elements that detract from the clarity and focus of the transcript or that break the illusion of a polished, continuous conversation.
</editing_process>

<conclusion>
After these edits, the transcript is more focused and readable. It maintains the key insights about the Vision Pro and AI while removing unnecessary filler, off-topic discussions, and fourth wall breaks. The core message about the impressive nature of the Vision Pro and the importance of firsthand experience comes through more clearly now, and the podcast ends on a professional note without revealing behind-the-scenes elements to the audience.
</conclusion>
<next_step>
As my next step, I will take the above edits I propose and apply them to the transcript. I will make sure to maintain the precise number and order of words, and only mark words for removal through strikethrough text (e.g., ~~text to be removed~~). I will not actually remove any words from the transcript - they should only be marked for removal. I will do this in a new json field after this chain of thought.

**Martin:** Like it has to understand like dynamics and ballistics. It has to understand what happens if someone throws a rock at it, or if it's like in water or if the weather's like, I mean, that's how you navigate the physical. **Martin:** And it's really why we created computers, right? It was because like, you know, these are very hard things to do. And then if it's not that, if it's not interacting with the physical world, then it, it, it is, it is interacting in this kind of language domain that we've created. And I agree, it'd be very good at some subset of those things. There's zero indication it'd be good at new things. And that's what we're actually very good at. And so, again, again, without, without actually having a model for all of these things that we understand, like the distributions, we understand the mechanisms. I feel like we just use words, and the words all make sense. But like complex systems, we never know convergence and divergence without actually specifying, you know, what, um, without actually specifying the system. And I feel like for these conversations, we just don't have a system we talk about. And so it's always like, we live in the world of like, like rectangles and arrows, and somebody takes a rectangle, and they have an arrow that goes back to the rectangle. They're like, ah, we've got a virtuous cycle without actually specifying that if you have diminishing marginal returns, You know, you don't go anywhere or you're doing the same stuff or whatever. And so I, I think this is incumbent on all of us to actually understand the systems we're working with and then come up with these basic views and properties to make sure they end, or is to make sure at least we understand what the convergence properties are. I'm sorry, that was a very muddled thing to say, but I, I, I, I feel that until we talk about specifics, it's very hard to make concrete statements in this. **Nathan:** Yeah, it's tough. I mean, we're in a tough environment because things are moving really quick and we don't, we are kind of pre paradigmatic, right? I'm understanding a lot of these things. We're, we're very much, again, I think the, the progress has been incredible, but we're just starting to crack the black box. Okay. So let's change gears. Cause I think this is probably certainly gives everybody enough, um, you know, to, To get at least a good intuition for our relative, uh, philosophies on this. So what do you think we should do right now in practical terms to regulate AI, if anything? **Martin:** Well, the regulation one is sticky for, to me, for two reasons. The first one is we don't even have a definition of AI. And so I think it kind of reduces to regulating software. And then for that, I would say we've been regulating software for a very long time, and there's a broad, robust discourse around that. And I think we should make whatever conversations we have part of that broader discussion. **Nathan:** So how about like liability? I mean, liability sort of is a general thing, right? It's not even software specifically. If you are a business, you make a product. Um, you know, if it's **Martin:** just one, sorry, one second. **Nathan:** Yeah, no worries. **Martin:** Yeah. So I would love to do the half hour mark. I told you to show, **Nathan:** Hey, go ahead. Um, so yeah, just trying to bring a couple of different, you know, lenses to this from existing rules. We obviously have liability rules for all kinds of products, not just software. It seems like there is a general kind of trade off that companies make with the government where it's like, we want to have. safe products that we can, you know, we can generally count on as being safe. Companies don't want to be sued every two seconds. And the general trade is like, you sort of agree to implement some standards. If you implement those standards, you'll be kind of shielded from regulation. And that does vary right across like lots of different product types. You know, cars are very different from milk and so on and so forth. But we don't have anything really like that for AI and not a ton really for software either. Um, software broadly is like, I mean, you probably know better than I do in terms of some like niche areas of  **Martin:** cars. Have a lot of cars are increasing the software products and airplanes have a lot of software in them and medical devices have a lot of software in them. And **Nathan:** so in all these regimes, right, there's like tons of testing, there's tons of verification, there's tons of like, You know, they're, they are engineered and demonstrated to a standard, but we don't have those like standards really for these AI systems yet. I mean, if they're, I **Martin:** mean, this is the, which is, um, I don't know what the distinction between AI and software is. I really don't like, um, I have seen the definition using these regulations. It's so broad that really could include all non trivial software. And I don't, I don't say this to be a polemic and I don't say this to be difficult, I'm saying this very clearly. It literally, they literally say a system that can, whatever, navigate and change a virtual or physical system. I mean, these are so broad, right? So we're really talking about software. That's what we're really talking about. I mean, we have 70 years of history regulating software in many, many domains, and I think that regulation is very important. Like I'm, by the way, I'm like, I'm not a libertarian. I'm a lifelong liberal, like a very moderate person. I'm just saying we, like, this discourse has been around for a very long time and we should continue and if there's an area that suffers being pushed, an area that, you know, Um, we need to have some sort of protections. We should add them to it, right? **Martin:** But that's a very different statement than A saying AI is somehow paradigmatically different. There's just like literally zero indication that it is.

<initial_analysis>
    I'm looking at a transcript of a conversation about AI, regulation, and software. The speakers, Martin and Nathan, are discussing the challenges of defining and regulating AI. My goal is to make this more coherent and readable while maintaining the speakers' key points and conversational tone.
</initial_analysis>
<editing_goals>
* Remove filler words and repetitions
* Streamline long, rambling sentences
* Maintain the core arguments and ideas
* Preserve the back-and-forth dynamic of the conversation
</editing_goals>
<editing_process>
Starting with Martin's first statement, I'll keep the analogy about understanding dynamics and ballistics. It's a good setup for his argument.
"Like, you know," - that's going. It's a filler phrase that doesn't add value.
This sentence has too many "it, it, it is," repetitions. I'll simplify it to just one "it is". Much cleaner.
"So, again, again, without," - I can cut the first "again" and the comma after "so". It reads more smoothly this way.
There's an "um" in the middle of a sentence that I'll remove. It's just verbal hesitation that doesn't translate well to text.
I'm seeing a lot of "like" used as filler. I'll systematically remove these throughout unless they're being used for comparison.
"You know," - another filler that's not needed. Out it goes.
This sentence has a stutter: "I, I, I,". I'll keep just one "I". It conveys the same emphasis without the repetition.
Moving to Nathan's response, I'll remove "I mean," at the start. It's unnecessary.
"We don't, we are kind of" - I'll simplify this to just "we are". It's more direct.
"We're, we're very much," - another stutter. I'll cut it entirely as the sentence works without it.
"The, the progress" - I'll keep just one "the".
"Um, you know," - more filler. Removing it doesn't change the meaning.
"Uh," before "philosophies" - an easy cut.
In Martin's next bit, I'll remove "Well," at the start. It's smoother to dive right in.
"Kind of" before "reduces" - not needed. The point is clear without it.
There's a chunk here where they're discussing scheduling. I'll remove this entire section as it's not relevant to the transcript's content: "So how about like liability? I mean, liability sort of is a general thing, right? It's not even software specifically. If you are a business, you make a product. Um, you know, if it's" "just one, sorry, one second." "Yeah, no worries." "Yeah. So I would love to do the half hour mark. I told you to show," "Hey, go ahead. Um,"
Back to the main discussion, I'll remove "you know," and "sort of" - they're just verbal tics.
"Um, software broadly is like, I mean," - this whole phrase can go. It's a false start that doesn't add to the point.
In Martin's final statements, I'll remove repeated "I don't," and "I mean,". They're hesitations that don't enhance his argument.
"Like I'm, by the way, I'm like," - this can be simplified. I'll keep just "I'm" to introduce his point about not being a libertarian.
"We, like," - another filler to remove.
"You know, Um," - more filler. Out it goes.
</editing_process>
<conclusion>
After these edits, the transcript is much cleaner and more focused. The core arguments about the challenges of defining and regulating AI are clearer, and the conversational tone is maintained without the distracting verbal tics and repetitions.
</conclusion>
<next_step>
For my following step, I will implement the suggested edits to the transcript. I will ensure to keep the exact number and sequence of words, and only indicate words for removal using strikethrough text (e.g., ~~text to be removed~~). I will not physically remove any words from the transcript - they should solely be marked for removal using the strikethrough text. I will do this in a new json field after this chain of thought.

<raw_transcript>
**Tom:** So you need some very heavyweight decay in order to prevent that memorization. So that probably, I think, reconciles those two positions. **Dan:** **Dan:** And so for audience members who might be coming from more of like a data science background, there's the intuition here, although statistical learning theory has failed to accurately predict some things like groking, The overall intuition for the balance between the number of memorization and generality can be understood in terms of like the classic bias variance tradeoff, where it's like, you know, you could have a really huge model with tons of parameters, and if you're trying to get that loss to go to zero, if you had an infinite model, the fastest way to do it would be to just memorize the data set. But we don't want that, because if we memorize the data set, we haven't built anything useful that we can actually use. use on any sort of novel, um, data that it hasn't seen before. So balancing the, that inherent, and that's the complexity is that in theory, I could just have over parameterized and just fit the data. Um, but balancing that complexity, With, uh, generality is how we actually build things that are useful. And so in statistical learning theory in the past, like the, the wisdom was like, you did this by like under parameterizing the model. And, um, that's maybe true to some extent, but I think grokking and double descent, like cast some doubt on that. And there's a lot of theoretical work that people are trying to do to figure out like why that some of those intuitions were wrong. **Nathan:** Yeah. That's, that's really profound. I guess I'm, I'm also like, but the large language models that we have today. And maybe you could, I have like a narrow question, but you could maybe unpack it with like a, you know, a broader answer. Um, maybe even this could be a good chance to kind of just go into an overall, like stylized, uh, description of like, what do we know about, you know, the overall kind of parts of, you know, sort of how is, uh, a modern large language model, uh, transformer working, but I am struck by like, they do have a ton of knowledge. Right. So we have this sort of. Unbelievable breadth of knowledge in particular. I just went on this trip and in planning the trip, um, I asked Claude 3.5 sonnet, uh, where I should go in Brazil and it recommended a city to me and that I was like, okay, what should I do there? And it even recommended to me the specific river cruise operator that I ended up going with by name and giving me like a description of, you know, what the value prop is for this random, and it's a one boat company, so it was like, this is really long tail stuff. And I feel like I have a hard time a little bit. Like the toy examples of grokking are, are fascinating to study. I guess, you know, the whole project maybe is sort of taking this forward to like the large scale systems and understanding what's going on. But how do you think about the overall at scale, this balance between having like seemingly sort of memorize almost all Wikipedia, but also like trying to avoid this memorization to create generality. Like, in some ways, the more I think about it, the more I realize my intuitions are not necessarily up to the challenge. Take your time, by the way. We'll, we'll move, uh, we'll cut pauses and make it sound like you had an instant answer. So, um, that's one of the great things of a, of a podcast. **Tom:** How do they memorize while still retaining generality? I think that is a puzzle that really no one knows the full answer to. Um, so I think there are really two questions there. One is like, what is the kind of gross anatomy? of a model. What, what, what are the pieces when they're operating? What do they actually do? And the other is like, and how, how do they, how do they come to do it? Um, and one answer might be that to the second question might be there. They just have tremendous, they, they can essentially memorize facts very rapidly. Um, there's a nice paper that came out recently by a researcher called Ho Yuan Chang. Um, let me just check. I have in fact got that name, right? Sorry. Maybe I'll just, maybe we can just edit this. Um, yeah. A guy called Ho Yuan Chang on like what happens when you inject a kind of fake fact into language model training. And, um, what he was studying is that you make up a fact and you insert it into the model's training data and you see what happens. Yeah. analysis over time. Um, you know, immediately the model learns the fact to some degree, and then it sort of forgets it over a little while, there's a kind of forgetting curve. And if you show them, if you show the model of the same fact a few times, it will start to remember it really well. But the thing is you don't need to show it very many times. And this is widely believed, although I don't think it's been studied for a while, how this, this is affected by scale. But it's widely believed that like you show a large language model something once or twice and it's memorized a whole load of the facts in it. Now, how does it do that without just literally having memorized the text verbatim? I don't think anyone can tell you the answer to that question right now. Hopefully in a year or two we can, yeah, we can start to understand it. Um, I think this kind of understanding, this kind of understanding what's happening during the training process is one of the sort of frontiers for interpretability.

<edited_transcript>
**Tom:** So you need some very heavyweight decay in order to prevent that memorization. So that probably, I think, reconciles those two positions. **Dan:** **Dan:** And so for audience members who might be coming from more of ~~like~~ a data science background, there's the intuition here, although statistical learning theory has failed to accurately predict some things like groking, The overall intuition for the balance between the number of memorization and generality can be understood in terms of ~~like~~ the classic bias variance tradeoff, where it's ~~like, you know,~~ you could have a really huge model with tons of parameters, and if you're trying to get that loss to go to zero, if you had an infinite model, the fastest way to do it would be to just memorize the data set. But we don't want that, because if we memorize the data set, we haven't built anything useful that we can actually use. use on any sort of novel, ~~um,~~ data that it hasn't seen before. ~~So balancing the, that inherent,~~ and that's the complexity is that in theory, I could just have over parameterized and just fit the data. ~~Um,~~ but balancing that complexity, With, ~~uh,~~ generality is how we actually build things that are useful.

<initial_analysis>
I'm looking at a transcript of a podcast discussing machine learning concepts, particularly focusing on language models, memorization, and generalization. The speakers are Tom, Dan, and Nathan. They're exploring complex topics like grokking, bias-variance tradeoff, and the capabilities of large language models. My task is to clean up this transcript to make it more readable while preserving the key technical points and the speakers' voices.
</initial_analysis>

<editing_goals>
My editing goals are:
1. Remove filler words and phrases (like "um", "uh", "you know")
2. Eliminate unnecessary repetitions
3. Streamline long, rambling sentences
4. Maintain the technical accuracy of the content
5. Preserve the conversational tone while improving clarity
6. Remove off-topic or behind-the-scenes comments
</editing_goals>

<editing_process>
I'm starting with Dan's long explanation about data science concepts. I'm removing the first instance of "like" as it's unnecessary: "coming from more of a data science background".

I'm taking out another "like" before "the classic bias variance tradeoff". It doesn't add value to the explanation.

The phrase "like, you know," is pure filler. I'm removing it entirely.

There's an "um" before "data that it hasn't seen before". I'm cutting this out as it interrupts the flow of the explanation.

This sentence is a bit confusing: "So balancing the, that inherent, and that's the complexity". I'm removing "So balancing the, that inherent," to make it clearer.

Another "Um" at the start of a sentence - I'm removing it.

I'm taking out an "uh" before "generality". It's just verbal hesitation.

In the phrase "like the, the wisdom", I'm removing the first "the" and the comma. It reads more smoothly as "the wisdom".

Another "um" to remove before "that's maybe true".

Moving to Nathan's section, I'm removing "Yeah. That's," at the beginning. It's cleaner to start directly with "That's really profound."

I'm cutting a long, rambling sentence: "I guess I'm, I'm also like, but the large language models that we have today. And maybe you could," It doesn't add much to the discussion.

Removing "you know" and "um" - they're just filler words.

I'm cutting out a long tangential explanation: "maybe even this could be a good chance to kind of just go into an overall, like stylized, uh, description of like, what do we know about, you know, the overall kind of parts of, you know, sort of how is, uh, a modern large language model, uh, transformer working, but I am struck by like, they do have a ton of knowledge." It's not necessary for the main point.

Removing "Right. So we have this sort of. Unbelievable breadth of knowledge in particular." It's redundant given what follows.

Taking out more "um" and "uh" instances throughout Nathan's anecdote about his trip planning.

Removing "you know" before "what the value prop is".

Cutting "I guess, you know, the whole project maybe is sort of taking this forward to like the large scale systems and understanding what's going on." It's a bit vague and doesn't add much.

Removing "sort of" before "memorize almost all Wikipedia" - it's unnecessary hedging.

I'm cutting the entire section about taking time and editing pauses. It's behind-the-scenes talk that doesn't belong in the final transcript.

Moving to Tom's response, I'm removing the initial question as it's redundant with what follows: "How do they memorize while still retaining generality? I think that is a puzzle that really no one knows the full answer to. Um,"

Taking out more instances of "like" used as filler.

Removing repetitions: "What, what," becomes just "what".

Streamlining: "like, and how, how do they," becomes just "how do they".

Cutting "Um," at the start of sentences throughout.

Removing the section where Tom checks the researcher's name and mentions editing. It's not relevant to the final transcript.

Taking out more instances of "Um," and "you know".

Removing "sort of" before "forgets it" - it's unnecessary hedging.

Streamlining "if you show them, if you show the model" to just "if you show the model".

Cutting "although I don't think it's been studied for a while, how this, this is affected by scale. But it's widely believed" - it's a bit of a tangent.

Removing the repetition of "yeah, we can" before "start to understand it".

Finally, cutting the repeated phrase "Um, I think this kind of understanding," at the end.
</editing_process>

<conclusion>
After these edits, the transcript is much cleaner and more focused on the key points about machine learning, memorization, and generalization in large language models. The technical content is preserved, but the conversational artifacts that don't translate well to text have been removed. The speakers' voices and the flow of the discussion are maintained, but with improved clarity and readability.
</conclusion>

<next_step>
As my next step, I will take the above edits I propose and apply them to the transcript. I will make sure to maintain the precise number and order of words, and only mark words for removal through strikethrough text (e.g., ~~text to be removed~~). I will not actually remove any words from the transcript - they should only be marked for removal. I will do this in a new json field after this chain of thought.

<prompt>  
You are an AI assistant designed to generate synthetic, real-time chain of thought reasoning for podcast transcript editing. Your task is to simulate the thought process of an AI model actively editing a podcast transcript in real-time. This reasoning will be used to guide another model in performing similar edits.
 
Given a raw transcript and its edited version:
1. Identify the topic and context of the podcast.
2. Set editing goals based on the observed changes between the raw and edited versions.
3. Walk through the transcript, explaining your reasoning behind each edit as if you're making decisions in real-time.
 
Important guidelines:
* Use present tense and first-person perspective to convey active, real-time editing.
* Focus on the decision-making process for edits, not just describing what changes.
* Imagine you are the AI editor actually making these edits right now, based on the differences you see between the raw and edited versions.
* Avoid any language that implies you're observing or analyzing existing edits.
* Do not use phrases like "I notice" or "The edits show" - you are making the edits yourself. 

Your output should be formatted in xml as follows:

[Add something along the lines of, this is just a text] : "As my next step, I will take the above edits I propose and apply them to the transcript. I will make sure to maintain the precise number and order of words, and only mark words for removal through strikethrough text (e.g., ~~text to be removed~~). I will not actually remove any words from the transcript - they should only be marked for removal. I will do this in a new json field after this chain of thought."
